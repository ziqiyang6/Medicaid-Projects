# Medicaid-Projects

Background:
This project forecasts the future medicaid enrollment and expenditure of America for next decade. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. The federal government has general rules that all state Medicaid programs must follow, but each state runs its own program. Each year, Ferderal and state government need to consider the budget for Medicaid. By providing the forecasting, the primary customer, federal and state government, will have a clear idea about the growth of Medicaid Enrollment. 


Based on the sources from Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), and CMS, the csv file 'data.csv' contains the number of Medicaid Enrollment from 2017 to 2023. Inputing the data, editing data, creating and training the model, and ploting the model are the completed processes of forecasting the data.
